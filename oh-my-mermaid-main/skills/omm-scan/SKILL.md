# omm-scan — Perspective-Based Architecture Scanner

## Purpose

Analyze the codebase and generate `.omm/` architecture documentation using **perspective-driven recursive analysis**.

- A **perspective** is a top-level element — a distinct way to look at the architecture.
- Each element in a diagram gets analyzed recursively. If it has internal structure, it becomes a **child element** (subdirectory with its own diagram). If not, it stays a leaf.
- The filesystem determines nesting. Element IDs in diagrams match child directory names. The viewer resolves groups from the filesystem.

## Prerequisites

```bash
command -v omm || npm install -g oh-my-mermaid
```

If the install fails, tell the user: "Please run `npm install -g oh-my-mermaid` in your terminal, then try again."

---

## Step 0: Check Language

```bash
omm config language
```

Write field content (description, context, constraint, concern, todo, note) in the configured language. Default is English. Element IDs, directory names, and diagram node IDs are always English kebab-case.

## Step 1: Explore the Codebase

Use Glob and Read to understand the project:

- Read `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, or equivalent manifests
- List top-level directories to identify module boundaries
- Read key entry points (main, index, app files)
- Look for route definitions, service layers, database connections, external integrations

## Step 2: Select Perspectives

From the catalog below, choose which perspectives are meaningful for this codebase.

### Perspective Catalog

| Perspective | When to create | What it answers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `overall-architecture` | **Always** | What exists and how pieces relate |
| `request-lifecycle` | Any server/API | How a request enters and gets handled end-to-end |
| `data-flow` | Any data processing, DB usage | Where data comes from, transforms, and lands |
| `dependency-map` | Complex module graph | What depends on what, what's shared |
| `external-integrations` | External APIs/services | What the system connects to and why |
| `state-transitions` | Stateful features (frontend or backend) | How state changes and what triggers it |
| `route-page-map` | Frontend with routing | Page structure and navigation flow |
| `command-surface` | CLI tools | Command hierarchy and dispatch |
| `extension-points` | Plugin/extension systems | Extension architecture and registry |
| `pipeline` | ML/data pipelines | Stage topology and data flow |
| `orchestration` | Event-driven/queue systems | Publisher, subscriber, broker topology |
| `storage` | 2+ storage systems | Storage topology (DB, cache, queue, object store) |

Don't force perspectives that don't exist in the code.

## Step 3: Generate Perspectives with Recursive Drill-Down

For each selected perspective, follow this recursive process:

### 3a. Write the perspective diagram

Element IDs match child directory names. The viewer resolves nesting from the filesystem.

```bash
omm write <perspective> diagram - <<'MERMAID'
graph LR
    renderer["Renderer\nsrc/renderer/"]
    renderer -->|"IPC invoke/on"| main-process["Main Process\nsrc/main/"]
    main-process -->|"spawn PTY"| engine-system["Engine System\nsrc/main/engine/"]
    main-process -->|"read/write JSON"| data-store["Data Store\nsrc/main/store.ts"]
    main-process -->|"xterm.js"| terminal-dock["Terminal Dock\nsrc/renderer/src/panel/"]
MERMAID
```

### 3b. Write the other 6 fields

Each as a separate `omm write` command: description, context, constraint, concern, todo, note.

### 3c. Recursive drill-down: analyze every element

**For every element in the diagram:**

1. **Analyze** the code it represents (Glob + Read the relevant files/directories)

2. **Write description for every node — no exceptions.** This creates the element directory. Optionally write other fields (context, constraint, concern, todo, note) if relevant — Write in the configured language.

   ```bash
   omm write <perspective>/<element-name> description - <<'EOF'
   (what this element does, which files/dirs it covers)
   EOF
   ```

3. **Decide leaf or group:**
   - **Distinct internal components found** → write a diagram and recurse deeper (it becomes a group)
   - **No meaningful sub-components** (single file, trivial wrapper, external system) → write remaining fields only (it stays a leaf)

4. **If group** — write diagram and recurse:

   ```bash
   omm write <perspective>/<element-name> diagram - <<'MERMAID'
   graph LR
       (internal elements)
   MERMAID
   ```

   Then repeat step 3c for each element in this diagram.

### Example recursion

```text
overall-architecture (perspective)
  elements: renderer, main-process, engine-system, data-store, terminal-dock

  → analyze renderer (src/renderer/)
    → finds: App.tsx, components/, hooks/, stores/, world/
    → group → write diagram with: components, stores, world
      → analyze components → 15 .tsx files, no sub-structure → leaf
      → analyze stores → 4 zustand stores → leaf
      → analyze world → OfficeCanvas + PixiJS logic → leaf

  → analyze main-process (src/main/)
    → finds: ipc.ts, auth/, engine/, terminal-session-service.ts, store.ts
    → group → write diagram with: auth, engine, terminal-session
      → analyze auth → auth-service.ts, callback-server.ts → leaf
      → analyze engine → claude-code.ts, codex.ts → leaf

  → analyze data-store (src/main/store.ts)
    → single file → leaf

  → analyze terminal-dock (src/renderer/src/panel/)
    → TerminalDock.tsx, DockManager → leaf
```

## Step 4: Summarize

Report what was created/updated and suggest `omm view` to view.

## Diagram Rules

- **Element IDs must match the child directory name.** Use kebab-case: `main-process`, `data-store`, `terminal-dock`.
- **Element labels use two-line format**: name + file path, separated by `\n`:

  ```text
  main-process["Main Process\nsrc/main/"]
  auth-service["Auth Service\nsrc/auth/service.ts"]
  ```

- Every edge must have a meaningful label: `A -->|"why this connection exists"| B`
- More elements in one diagram means you should recurse deeper.
- Use `graph LR` for most diagrams, `graph TD` for hierarchies.
- Use `classDef` for visual distinction when helpful:

  | Style | Color | When to use |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `external` | `#585b70` | Third-party services outside your codebase |
  | `concern` | `#f38ba8` | Known risk or bottleneck |
  | `entry` | `#89b4fa` | Entry points (HTTP handler, CLI, queue consumer) |
  | `store` | `#a6e3a1` | Persistent storage (DB, cache, file system) |

  ```text
  classDef external fill:#585b70,stroke:#585b70,color:#cdd6f4
  classDef concern fill:#f38ba8,stroke:#f38ba8,color:#1e1e2e
  classDef entry fill:#89b4fa,stroke:#89b4fa,color:#1e1e2e
  classDef store fill:#a6e3a1,stroke:#a6e3a1,color:#1e1e2e
  ```

## General Rules

- **Write each field as a separate `omm write` command.** Each `omm write` must be its own Bash tool call.
- Do not rewrite elements that haven't changed.
- Do not create circular references. A child element must never reference its parent.
